The Liskov Substitution Principle is a Substitutability principle in 
object-oriented programming Language. 
This principle states that, 
<<if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T 
should be replaced with the objects of type S.>>
<<if S=Orange is a subtype of T=Apple, then objects of type T 
should be replaced with the objects of type S.>>
