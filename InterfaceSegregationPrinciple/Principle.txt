The Interface Segregation Principle states that 
“Clients should not be forced to implement any methods they don’t use. 
Rather than one fat interface, 
numerous little interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods 
with each interface serving one submodule“.

Let us break down the above definition into two parts.

First, no class should be forced to implement any method(s) 
of an interface they don’t use.

Secondly, instead of creating large or you can say fat interfaces, 
create multiple smaller interfaces with the aim that the clients should only 
think about the methods that are of interest to them.
As per the Single Responsibility Principle of SOLID, 
like classes, interfaces also should have a single responsibility. 
That means we shouldn’t force any class to implement any method(s) 
which they don’t require
